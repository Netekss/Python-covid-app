    <h3>Wash your hands often</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
        <li>It’s especially important to wash:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Before eating or preparing food</li>
            <li>Before touching your face</li>
            <li>After using the restroom</li>
            <li>After leaving a public place</li>
            <li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
            <li>After handling your mask</li>
            <li>After caring for someone sick</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoid close contact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li>
            <li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li>
            <li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.</li>
        <li>The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.</li>
        <li>
            Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
            <ul>
                <li>Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders.</li>
        <li>Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clean and disinfect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
        <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
        <li>Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectantsexternal will work.</li>
    </ul>
